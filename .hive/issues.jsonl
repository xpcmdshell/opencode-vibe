{"id":"opencode-next--xts0a-mjq92i90uko","title":"Integrate multi-server SSE into session pages","description":"## Context\n\nWe implemented multi-server SSE discovery to show real-time session status on the projects list page. This discovers ALL running opencode processes (TUIs, serves) on the machine and aggregates their SSE events.\n\n## What Was Built\n\n### 1. Server Discovery API Route\n**File:** `apps/web/src/app/api/opencode-servers/route.ts`\n- Uses `lsof` to find all bun/opencode processes listening on TCP ports\n- Verifies each is an opencode server by hitting `/project` endpoint\n- Returns `Array<{ port: number; pid: number }>`\n\n### 2. Multi-Server SSE Manager\n**File:** `apps/web/src/core/multi-server-sse.ts`\n- `MultiServerSSE` class that:\n  - Polls `/api/opencode-servers` every 5s to discover servers\n  - Maintains SSE connections to each discovered server's `/global/event`\n  - Uses `EventSourceParserStream` for proper SSE parsing\n  - Reconnects automatically on disconnect\n  - Cleans up connections when servers die\n  - Aggregates `session.status` events from all servers\n- Exports singleton `multiServerSSE`\n\n### 3. ProjectsList Integration\n**File:** `apps/web/src/app/projects-list.tsx`\n- Added `useMultiServerSSE()` hook that:\n  - Starts multi-server discovery on mount\n  - Subscribes to status updates from all servers\n  - Updates store with session status events\n- Also kept `useBootstrapStatuses()` which derives initial status from messages (last message without `completed` time = running)\n- Also kept `useSSESubscription()` for main `opencode serve` SSE\n\n### 4. Store Updates\n**File:** `apps/web/src/react/store.ts`\n- Updated `session.status` handler to accept both:\n  - `{ type: \"busy\" | \"retry\" | \"idle\" }` from backend\n  - `{ running: boolean }` from SSE\n\n### 5. UI Updates\n- Green pulsing dot for running sessions\n- Gray dot for idle sessions\n- Footer with GitHub link and padding\n\n## What Needs To Be Done\n\n### Integrate multi-server SSE into session pages\n\nThe session detail page (`apps/web/src/app/session/[id]/session-layout.tsx`) currently only uses single-server SSE via `OpenCodeProvider`. It should also use multi-server SSE so that:\n\n1. If viewing a session running in a TUI (not `opencode serve`), you get real-time updates\n2. Status indicator shows correctly regardless of which process is running the session\n\n### Implementation Plan\n\n1. Create a `useMultiServerSSE` hook in `apps/web/src/react/` that can be used by any component\n2. Update `SessionLayout` or `SessionMessages` to subscribe to multi-server SSE\n3. The existing `OpenCodeProvider` SSE is still needed for:\n   - Creating new sessions\n   - Sending messages\n   - File search, etc.\n4. Multi-server SSE augments it for status monitoring\n\n### Architecture\n\n```\nopencode serve (:4056)          <- API for actions (new session, send message)\n       +\nMulti-Server SSE                <- Status from ALL processes\n       =\nComplete real-time experience\n```\n\n### Files to Modify\n- `apps/web/src/react/use-multi-server-sse.ts` (new hook)\n- `apps/web/src/app/session/[id]/session-layout.tsx` or `session-messages.tsx`\n\n### Testing\n- Start a session in TUI\n- Open web app to that session\n- Verify green dot appears and updates in real-time","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T21:37:08.580Z","updated_at":"2025-12-28T21:52:30.398Z","closed_at":"2025-12-28T21:52:30.398Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}

Scroll Bounce Fix ✅\n**File:** `apps/web/src/components/ai-elements/conversation.tsx`\n- Added `scrollToBottomInstant()` for auto-scroll (no animation)\n- `scrollToBottom()` kept smooth for manual button clicks\n- ResizeObserver now uses instant scroll\n- Initial page load uses instant scroll\n- Prevents overlapping smooth scrolls that caused bounce\n\n### 3. Surfer Loader ✅\n**Files:** \n- `apps/web/src/components/ai-elements/loader.tsx` - Replaced spinner with 🏄‍♂️\n- `apps/web/src/app/globals.css` - Added `animate-surf` keyframes\n\n### 4. Store Hydration ✅ COMPLETE\n**Files:**\n- `apps/web/src/react/store.ts` - Added `hydrateMessages()` method (idempotent, binary search insertion)\n- `apps/web/src/app/session/[id]/session-messages.tsx` - Synchronous hydration before first render\n- `apps/web/src/app/session/[id]/page.tsx` - Passes raw OpenCodeMessages\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Synchronous hydration during render (before hooks)\n- Idempotent check prevents double-hydration\n- All 12 integration tests pass\n- Verified by Worker 2 (WarmStone) - no flash, messages appear immediately\n\n## Cells Created\n- `opencode-next--xts0a-mjqbm7xyzse` - Future improvement: use prompt_async + SSE\n- `opencode-next--xts0a-mjqcwkjhpn1` - ROLLBACK needed for layout changes","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T23:24:49.755Z","updated_at":"2025-12-29T04:14:11.159Z","closed_at":"2025-12-29T04:14:11.159Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
